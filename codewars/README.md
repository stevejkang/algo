## Directory Naming Convention
1. The directory name is the same as the problem name but it must start with an upper-case letter and every word should be linked to a dash. Also, some special characters are could be ignored when it considered as meaningless usage.
2. The directory name must be named with its permalink(specifically, 'hash') at the end.
> For example, problem 'Multiply' has `https://www.codewars.com/kata/50654ddff44f800200000004` as permalink, so its directory name should be `Multiply-50654ddff44f800200000004`
